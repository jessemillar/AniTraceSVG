AniTraceSVG
===========

A while back, video game blog Polygon posted review of the PS4 and Xbox One using animated headers for the top of the articles.  These animations, which cleanly animated a traced outline of the devices being reviewed, gained a lot of attention.  I wanted to have a similar effect on my website, so I made this library.  It's pretty simple, but gets the job done.

For fun, here's a link to Polygon's post about the creation of the effect: http://product.voxmedia.com/2013/11/25/5426880/polygon-feature-design-svg-animations-for-fun-and-profit
